<h1>0x09. Island Perimeter</h1>
<h2>Algorithm Python</h2>
<p>The following directory will be used for tackling the following interview question</p>
<p>Create a function def island_perimeter(grid): that returns the perimeter of the island described in grid:</p>
<ul>
	<li>grid is a list of integers:
		<ul>
			<li>0 represents water</li>
			<li>1 represents land</li>
			<li>Each cell is square, with a side length of 1</li>
			<li>Cells are connected horizontally/vertically(not diagonally).</li>
			<li>grid is rectangular, with its width and height not exceeding 100</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The grid is completely surrounded by water</li>
	<li>There is only one island (or nothing).</li>
	<li>The island doesn’t have “lakes” (water inside that isn’t connected to the water surrounding the island).</li>
</ul>
